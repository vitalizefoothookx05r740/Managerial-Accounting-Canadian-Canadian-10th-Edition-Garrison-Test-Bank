Chapter 6 Systems Design: Process Costing

Solution to Discussion Case Estimating percentage of completion of products requires a judgment call. As with all areas where judgment comes to play, managers will tend to be more or less conservative depending on several factors including the degree to which they inherently tend toward conservative estimates and forecasts. From the perspective of the organization, the objective is to provide as accurate an estimate of percentage of completion as possible in order to better understand and control costs and to ensure the integrity of the costing system. Even so, managers also have incentives to improve profit, both for the shareholder's sake as well as to meet performance evaluation and bonus targets each year. But “misestimating” is likely of only short term benefit since the Board will quite quickly fail to trust the manager's esti-

mated percentage of completion if they prove to be wrong over several periods. Once this happens, the company would be foolish to continue to provide incentives to base bonuses on divisional profit figures if these figures cannot be trusted. In the end, the benefit of subverting the integrity of the accounting system is likely much lower than the potential long-term reputational cost.

Solutions to Questions 6-1 A process costing system should be used in situations where a homogeneous products or services are produced on a continuous basis. 6-2 1. In job-order costing many different jobs are worked on during each period each with its own production requirements. In process costing, a single product is produced on a continuous basis and all units are identical. 2. The job cost sheet is the key document in job-order costing while the department production report is the key document in process costing. 3. Unit costs are computed by job in job-order costing while unit costs are computed by department in process costing. 6-3 Cost accumulation is simpler under process costing because costs only need to be assigned to departments—not separate jobs. A company usually has a small number of processing departments, whereas a job-order costing system often must keep track of the costs of hundreds or even thousands of jobs.

6-8 Disagree. In fact, flexible manufacturing systems may actually increase the use of process costing over time. These systems can have a major impact on costing since they allow for an easy switch from producing one type of product to another. The systems’ flexibility means product switching results in little time lost and relatively low setup costs. Therefore, companies are able to move between products with about the same speed as they would if they were working in a continuous processing environment. As the use of flexible manufacturing systems grows, so should the application of process costing techniques. 6-9 Advantages of the weighted average method include: computations are simpler; the managers does not need information at too fine a level of detail so the average is informative enough; there is little change in cost from period to period; ending inventory are typically low each period so the average ends up being quite accurate.

6-4 In a process costing system, a Work in Process account is maintained for each processing department. 6-5 The journal entry would be: Work in Process,- Firing ...... XXXX Work in Process-, Mixing ... XXXX 6-6 The costs that might be added to the Firing Department’s Work in Process account during the period are, (1) transferred-in costs from the Mixing Department; (2) materials costs; (3) labour costs; and (4) overhead costs added in the Firing Department. 6-7 Under the weighted-average method, equivalent units of production consist of units transferred to the next department (or to finished goods) during the period plus the equivalent units in the department’s ending work in process inventory.

If there is sufficient idle capacity to process an additional 1,000 units, the incremental cost per unit is almost certainly less than £3.17 per unit because the conversion costs are likely to include fixed costs.

This problem becomes particularly significant when attempting to measure performance in the current period. Good (or bad) cost control in the current period might be concealed by the costs that have been brought forward in the beginning inventory.
